## Switch from Drupal to Golang

### Reason:
I have worked as a Drupal developer/contributor for several years(https://www.drupal.org/user/2936003/), I's a fantastic tool, but its market is smaller and smaller in China. 

### Future
I will put my energy in golang and use a new English name **Lawxen** from now on .(PS: My former name is Kaysenlau and caseylau).
